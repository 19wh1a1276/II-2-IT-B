#### 17 - 06 - 2021 PROGRAMS :
- Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First thread generates random integer every 1 second and if the value is even, second     thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd, the third thread will print the value of cube of the number.
- Write a Java program for the following:
         - Create a doubly linked list of elements.
         - Delete a given element from the above list.
         - Display the contents of the list after deletion

- Write a Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and an empty method named print Area (). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method print Area () that prints the area of the given shape.

- Write java program that loads names and phone numbers from a text file where the data is organized as one line per record and each field in a record are separated by a tab (\t). It takes a name or phone number as input and prints the corresponding other value from the hash table (hint: use hash tables).

- Write a Java program that correctly implements the producer â€“ consumer problem using the concept of interthread communication.

- Write a Java program to list all the files in a directory including the files present in all its subdirectories.

- Write a Java program that implements Quick sort algorithm for sorting a list of names in ascending order

- Write a Java program that implements Bubble sort algorithm for sorting in descending order and also shows the number of interchanges occurred for the given set of integers.
